# BREWTHEME HELP
This submodule contains parameter specific Stata help files for the `brewtheme` command.  Due to the number of optional parameters and valid arguments within each of the parameters, it should make it easier for end users to navigate the helpfile with each parameter having it's own sub-help page.  

# Status
Currently, these files only contain the shell's needed for the helpfiles.  As time permits, these files will be populated.

# Usage
More generally, the parameters for the `brewtheme` program accept arguments of the form: `"key value" "key2 value2" "key3 value3" ...`.  Where the keys will be the documented valid arguments in the help file and the value will be the user specified modification to that argument.
